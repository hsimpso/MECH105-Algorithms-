# Simpson's 1/3 Rule  
## This algorithm will calculate the numerical value of an integral using the Simpson's 1/3 Rule
* **Inputs:**
   1. x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
   2. y = the vector of function values with respect to x    
 * **Outputs:**
   1. I = the numerical integral calculated
