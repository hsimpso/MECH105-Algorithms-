# MECH105-Algorithms
These are the numerical method algorithms I created for MECH105, Colorado State University, Fall 2021.

The Algorithms:

1. **False Position**- This algorithm will use the False Position method to find the root of a function.
2. **LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting**- This algorithm will use LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting to solve a system of equations.  
3. **Simpson's 1/3 Rule**- This algorithm will calculate the numerical value of an integral using the Simpson's 1/3 Rule
